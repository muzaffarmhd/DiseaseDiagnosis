# Multiple disease prediction system
A Machine Learning based 
-Heart Disease Prediction
-Diabeties Prediction
-Pneumonia Prediction using Image

To run and test:
1. Create a virtual environment and move to it.
2.     pip install -r requirements.txt
### On Mac/Linux:
    sudo chmod +x runmac.sh
    ./runmac.sh
### On Windows:
    ./runwindows.bat

The model was trained using Support Vector Machine ML algorithm, and the data was collected from kaggle.com
### Note:
    This project was done in collaboration with @muzzlol as a part of CodeCon Hackathon(2023)
